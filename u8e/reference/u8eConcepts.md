###  1: Tempestry Magic System and Inheritance
Confirming Tempestry as a playable magic system in the original Ultima VIII and exploring its inheritance mechanics including potential plot cuts.

- **dryazman** shares that Lord British confirmed Tempestry was intended to be playable. He is awaiting responses to follow-up questions.
- **thegreywanderer** questions when the Avatar would gain access to Tempestry, speculating that the genetic inheritance (passed via family bloodlines) might have been a deliberate plot cut. This could explain why the Avatar never receives it and why Hydros betrays him. If genetics were cut, access could be immediate once Hydros agrees, fitting a revised plot.
- **dryazman** agrees these are valid points and plans to consult Lord British further.
- **thegreywanderer** offers to compile ideas and questions after finishing current work.
- **dryazman** notes the lineage concept feels like a cut element and shares his specific questions to Lord British:
  - If Tempestry is inherited through family lineage, how can the Avatar acquire it ("stealing" from Hydros, teaching, or a ritual)?
  - Are there other descendants from the lineages, such as in a water-themed city connected to Hydros, including additional Tempests from the Tenebrae line?
- He emphasizes limiting questions to 2-3 at a time to avoid overwhelming Lord British.
- **thegreywanderer** compiles notes on Tempestry:
  1. Tempestry is granted only from Hydros.
  2. Previously granted to the Tempests by Hydros and follows the Tempest bloodline.
  3. Tempestry requires only thought to invoke, requires not the use of reagents, words of power, or foci objects.
  4. Hydros was going to grant the Avatar Tempestry before cheating him.
  - Q1. Was Tempestry always designed as above, or are some/all of the above devices used as a result of plot cuts.
  - Q2. If the plan was to have the Avatar granted the power of Tempestry by Hydros and the Avatar was then known by the people of Pagan to have this power; How might that have affected the relationship between Devon and the Avatar?
  - Q3. Did Hydros give true power, as in sacrificed part of her power, to the Tempests or did Hydros only provide a link to her power to the Tempests.
  - Q4. If Hydros gave true power to the Tempests, would then the defeated Hydros in the Tear of the Seas hold enough power to charge the obelisk part to a degree sufficient to rebuild and complete the Obelisk, or, does this power need to be reclaimed in some fashion; Devon to give it up or… a darker outcome.
  - Q5. The Tempest, Mordea, ruling Pagan had appeared to use a Wand. What was it and why was it used, could it be part of Tempestry casting planned but cut?

###  2: Tempestry Plot Elements and New Ideas
Brainstorm ways to integrate Tempestry into the game's plot while preferring to stay close to original content.

- **thegreywanderer** suggests plot integrations like tricking Hydros into granting Tempestry before her betrayal or stealing it. This could prove her deception, give the Avatar a throne claim, and create tension with Devon. He volunteers to write details.
- **dryazman** responds to darker twists (sacrificing Mordea and Devon for the obelisk) but prefers minimal deviations: restore cuts, add NPCs/side areas, and fill gaps (water city).
- **thegreywanderer** clarifies: If Hydros imparted power to the Tempest bloodline, it must be reclaimed for the Tear's obelisk power. Options include a confrontation where Devon and Mordea kill each other or Devon surrenders power after Mordea's death.
- **dryazman** acknowledges this for Tempestry lore but stresses keeping Devon alive as the first recruitable NPC. He leaves the party to become mayor but recurs for advice, like Lord British, due to his travels.
- **thegreywanderer** proposes a ritual where Devon transfers power to the Avatar using the Tear.

###  3: Family Lineages and Additional Tempests
Expand on Tempest family trees - branches in new areas like the water city - mechanics like sacrifices to enhance plot depth.

- **dryazman** proposes expanding the Tempest family tree with a branch in the water city, possibly incorporating a sacrifice mechanic.
- **thegreywanderer** suggests Kalen's love interest could be alive or have descendants in another tree, perhaps semi-immortal or ghostly.
- **dryazman** notes families rarely stay single-branch over centuries; high mortality aside, multiple descendants are likely. He suggests a distant cousin or elderly Tempest woman in the water city who sacrifices herself in a ritual to banish Hydros.
- **thegreywanderer** refines this: She could be Devon's grandmother (Keldan's mother), though he admits limited knowledge of Devon's backstory.

###  4: Tempestry Casting Mechanics and Lore
How Tempestry spells are cast drawing from game lore (no reagents, foci, or words) and proposing implementation ideas like wands or interfaces.

- **thegreywanderer** notes Mordea uses a wand; suggests a single focus for activation/spell selection, as blood-based free casting might be a cut element.
- **dryazman** proposes a Harry Potter-style wand; Tempestry functions like Thaumaturgy but free. Suggests binding Hydros to a wand during banishment for Avatar use.
- **thegreywanderer** ideas: Context-specific effects (wand on water vs. fire); blood rite activation or tying to the Tear during key events.
- **dryazman** brainstorms dialog-triggered spells or wand interface for phrases, but notes situational limitations.
- **thegreywanderer** suggests {T}-marked Tempest dialogue options for spells.
- **stardrop_thistledown** references manual: No components needed, amplified by Hydros; jokes about EEG headset with Exult support.
- **thegreywanderer** proposes hotkeys.
- **dryazman** questions original intent, citing Lord British on unique systems.
- **thegreywanderer** notes bloodline can stay even if cut; recalls Thaumaturgy uses scrolls.
- **dryazman** confirms Thaumaturgy requires regs for scrolls; suggests mana-only free casting for Tempestry.
- **thegreywanderer** likens to Baldur's Gate-style list selection.
- **dryazman** ideas: Meditation or pendant instead of wand.
- **thegreywanderer** says any item works, per Mordea.
- **dryazman** favors wand with keywords ("aqua, coris" selects; auto-casts last spell until reset).

###  5: Resurrection Spell in Theurgy
Handling the Resurrection spell - restrict it or make it available post-key events.

- **thegreywanderer** asks if Avatar gains it without blindness or restricts to Stellos as original.
- **stardrop_thistledown** jokes: Grant it but black out screen forever.
- **dryazman** proposes limit to Stellos until Stratos' banishment, then available.
- **thegreywanderer** corrects: It's Stratos' magic, granted only to Stellos.
- **stardrop_thistledown** confirms Stellos' uniqueness; cool post-banishment bonus after "eating" Stratos.
- **thegreywanderer** suggests Breath of Air as late-game focus.
- **dryazman** agrees or create new focus.

###  6: Fifth Titan and Exiled Character Idea
A student-created character obsessed with a fifth titan - refined for lore fit as a theurgist rather than sorcerer.

- **dryazman** shares concept: Retired sorcerer obsessed with fifth titan (blinded Stellos), built observatory, forced out by Enclave.
- **totalimmortal** praises it.
- **gwchapman** notes poor fit for sorcerers (no retirements, advancement via killing; Malchir asked Pyros directly); reframe as expelled theurgist for "insulting" Stratos.
- **.sethanon** agrees theurgist better; explore other titans.
- **dryazman** says tweaks needed (student unfamiliar with game); core solid.
- **.sethanon** questions thaumaturgy: Ether-based or mix? Mythran sole practitioner?
- **dryazman** assumes ether; Zealans magical.
- **gwchapman** views as pure Sosarian magic.
- **.sethanon** sees as blending elements per Mythran.
- **dryazman** references Malchir's sun/blindness dialog.
- **gwchapman** adds Malchir would support; expulsion unlikely.
- **dryazman** adaptations: Fled voluntarily or barred until evidence.

####  6a: Sorcerers' Purpose and Lore
Clarifying sorcerers' role, origins, and isolationist nature in Pagan's society.

- **.sethanon** asks on thaumaturgy expansion: Ether or mix? Mythran only?
- **dryazman** notes Beren works for Tenebrae.
- **.sethanon** infers containing Pyros.
- **dryazman** clarifies imprisonment backstory; library, feared.
- **.sethanon** describes isolationists hoarding power; wiki says from theurgists.
- **gwchapman** likens to Discworld wizards: Scheming, internally focused.

####  6b: Fifth Titan Character Placement and Quest
Placing the fifth titan character in Stone Cove, with quest ties and town details for outcasts.

- **dryazman** adapts as theurgist; quest: Visit Sorcerers' Enclave for research.
- **.sethanon** calls intriguing side quest.
- **dryazman** suggests temporary companion; Stone Cove for exiles.
- **.sethanon** proposes alchemy shop.
- **dryazman** agrees; settlements Titan-connected; Stone Cove near Tenebrae, safe; ropemaker economy, fishers; Paws-sized; alchemy deters attacks.
- **.sethanon** Hydros tie prevents Mordea; hidden like U9 Cove.
- **gwchapman** Too insignificant for resources; Mordea prioritizes city.
- **.sethanon** Preoccupied with traitors.

####  6c: Sorcerers and Theurgists History
Deep dive into origins, tying to Sun Seeker NPC and blackrock artifacts.

- **thegreywanderer** Sorcerers from theurgists; use for Sun Seeker ties. Quotes book: Theurgists revered then shunned; labeled for daemons, isolated. Violent leadership changes. Blackrock as obelisk shards? Tongue of Flame from large piece to bind Pyros.
- **thegreywanderer** Frame Sun Seeker as theurgist: Banned for heresy; observatory insulted Stratos; descendant of Pyros pacifiers; resents bloodline, obsesses over fifth titan.

###  7: Vengeance Bay Town Concept
Vengeance Bay as a nomadic ship-based town - with trade and worship ties.

- **dryazman** Needs equipped ship for storms.
- **thegreywanderer** Ghost ship with undead?
- **dryazman** For quests, not town; nomadic Quarian-like ships—test idea.
- **.sethanon** Morrowind elements.
- **dryazman** NPC locates position; static for functionality. Floating markets-inspired with larger vessels.
- **Stardrop** Nomadic linked ships?
- **dryazman** Trade lumber/transport (with Treasure Cove/Argentrock); tree biome; Stratos worship aids weather. 2-3 land camps; offshore ships as "town."

###  8: Mining Town in Treasure Cove and Lost Vale
Details on a mining town as gateway to Lost Vale, with plot ties and access mechanics.

- **dryazman** describes Treasure Cove mining town: Ore source for Tenebrae; sealed by Mordea; accessible post-Devon as Tempest.
- **.sethanon** asks plot significance.
- **dryazman** Gateway to Lost Vale; resolve issues to enter mines, free Zealan Gods.
- **.sethanon** Plateau doors first?
- **dryazman** Yes; original cuts misplaced elements; Lord British confirmed 1:1 map scope; spread content logically.


###  9: Unspecified Red Circled Area Ideas
Ideas for an undeveloped map area, favoring ruins or quests over new towns.

- **dryazman** Avoid town; perhaps dungeon.
- **.sethanon** Black Dragon castle ruins (if Pagan = Lands of Dark Unknown)?
- **dryazman** Not Lands (per Lord British).
- **gwchapman** Place anyway, relocated via storms.
- **.sethanon** Debunked theory; Zealan ruins for ancient feel.
- **dryazman** Ruins solid; alternative: Rogue sorcerer quest from mining town/Stone Cove; eliminate base.
- **.sethanon** Random discovery; reward weapon/armor.

###  10: Teleport Pads and Fast Travel
Teleport pads vs. lore-friendly alternatives like Boatman for fast travel.

- **thegreywanderer** Pads likely dev tools; lacking lore.
- **dryazman** Retain if original; Boatman for sea.
- **thegreywanderer** Ditch for better; link to Silver Tree/Elerion for Zealan history.
- **dryazman** Boatman dialog-triggered routes (Tenebrae to Argentrock).
- **.sethanon** Teleports for inland.
- **dryazman** Tunnel as teleport skip; sea unlocks post-visit. Vengeance Bay needs storm-resistant ship; dedicated NPC.
